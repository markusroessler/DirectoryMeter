## About
If you ever wondered where all your disk space gone to, DirectoryMeter is the right tool for you.  
It computes the size of selected directories (or complete drives) and all its sub directories. This way you can easily track down these big files.  
Additionaly you can mark files and directories as "expendable" so you can quickly free up space when you need to. So "expendable" is kind of the predecessor of "trash".
