## About
If you ever wondered where all your disk space has gone to DirectoryMeter is the right tool for you.  
It computes the size of selected directories (or complete drives) and all its sub directories. This way you can easily track down those big files.  
Additionaly files and directories can be marked as "expendable" (kind of the predecessor of "trash") so you can quickly find these files later to free up disk space.
